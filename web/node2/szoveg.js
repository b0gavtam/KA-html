I can't fight it much longer
Somethings tryin' to get out
And it's never been closer

If my take-off fails
Make up some other story
But if I never come back
Tell my mother I'm sorry

Baby, now Im ready moving on
Oh, but maybe I was ready all along
Oh, Im ready for the moment and the sound
Oh, but maybe I was ready all along

Baby, now I'm ready, moving on
Oh, but maybe I was ready all along
Oh, Im ready for the moment and the sound
Oh, but maybe I was ready all along`, (err) =>
